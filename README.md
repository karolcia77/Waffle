## Usage

```shell script
Î»  ./target/debug/waffle --help
WAFFLE 0.1
iy <github.com/Nyanguy>
It's a stack-based VM!

USAGE:
    waffle [SUBCOMMAND]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    help       Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    syrup      Creates a bytecode file.
    titbits    Reverses specified bytecode file into the waffle source code.
    with       Runs specified bytecode file.
```


## How does it work?

You can find example code [here](test). 
Each instruction takes 8 bits with integers and float numbers as 64 bits (a subject to change in the future as an argument to the VM).
Allocated memory size can be managed with a cli argument. By default it's 1Kb.
